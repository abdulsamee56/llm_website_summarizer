Website Summarizer
Website Summarizer is a lightweight Python-Django application that allows users to enter a URL of a website and generates a concise summary of the website's content. The app uses OpenAI's GPT API for summarization and BeautifulSoup for extracting content from the given URL.

Current Features
Summarize Website Content:

Users can paste the URL of a website, and the app fetches the content of the webpage (excluding images, scripts, etc.).
The extracted text is summarized using OpenAI's GPT API to generate a concise and meaningful summary.
Supports Static HTML Websites:

Works well with websites that serve static content.
Simple and Intuitive Interface:

Users can enter a URL and instantly receive a summary.
Future Enhancements
Job Posting Summarizer and ATS Keyword Extractor:

Extend the app to summarize job descriptions from popular job posting websites.
Extract key skills and keywords (e.g., Python, SQL, Agile) required for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems).
Allow users to paste job links for automatic analysis.
Handle JavaScript-Heavy Websites:

Incorporate headless browsers like Selenium or Playwright to process dynamic content.
Support File Uploads:

Enable users to upload HTML or text files containing job descriptions or web content for summarization.
Store Summaries and Keywords:

Add functionality to save summaries and keywords in a database for future reference.
Improve UI and UX:

Enhance the app's interface with a responsive design using frameworks like Bootstrap or TailwindCSS.
